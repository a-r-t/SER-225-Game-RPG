# Play Level Screen

The screen handles the logic and graphics related to playing the actual platformer game that is loaded  when the "PLAY GAME" option is selected form the game's main menu.

The class file for it is `PlayLevelScreen.java` which can be found in the `Screens` package.

## Functionality

This is the screen where the platformer game is actually played! The map and player are loaded and the game carries out from here until the level
is beaten or the player dies. Despite the `PlayLevelScreen` class having to seemingly do so much, a vast majority of the platformer game code
is abstracted away from it (mostly residing in the `Player` and `Map` classes) which keeps the screen's code pretty simple and easy to follow.

The `PlayLevelScreenState` enum defined in the class is used to determine what the `PlayLevelScreen` should be doing at a specific point in time --
its "current flagManager" is stored in the `playLevelScreenState` instance variable. There are several different states that the `PlayLevelScreen` can be in:
- **RUNNING** -- platformer game is currently running (map is loaded, player can move around/jump, etc.)
- **LEVEL_COMPLETED** -- the level has been completed (beaten), which happens when the player hits the golden box at the end of the level
- **PLAYER_DEAD** -- the player has lost the level by being killed by an enemy (which happens if you touch an enemy)
- **LEVEL_WIN_MESSAGE** - after the player has beaten the level, a "level win message" is shown to the player -- this flagManager is used after the LEVEL_COMPLETED flagManager
- **LEVEL_LOSE_MESSAGE** - after the player has lost the level by being killed by an enemy, a "level lose message" is shown to the player -- this flagManager is used after the PLAYER_DEAD flagManager  

### Running State

The `RUNNING` flagManager is the default flagManager that the `PlayLevelScreen` is set to when it first loads (this is done in the `initialize` method)

As mentioned earlier, while this flagManager does have the most going on considering it's the actual game itself being run,
all the game code is abstracted away to the `Map` and `Player` classes, meaning this is the only thing `PlayLevelScreen` has to do for this flagManager:

`update` method:
```java
player.update();
map.update(player);
```

and

`draw` method:
```java
map.draw(graphicsHandler);
player.draw(graphicsHandler);
```

Basically, the `Map` and `Player` classes are updated and drawn each cycle, and they handle the rest of the work.
The specific `Map` and `Player` class instance used for the level is defined in the `initialize` method -- at the moment
this game currently only has one playable map (`TestMap.java` file in the `Map` package) and one player type (`Cat.java` file in the `Players` package).
From there, the `PlayLevelScreen` just continually calls their `update` and `draw` methods to carry out the platformer game. The documentation
for the `Map` class is located [here](../map.md), and for the `Player` class is located [here](../player.md).

When in this flagManager, the platformer game can be played!

### Level Completed State

When the player reaches the end of the level and hits the gold block, the level is "completed" and the `PlayLevelScreen's` flagManager
is changed to `LEVEL_COMPLETED`. Note that this flagManager change is actually triggered by the `Player`, which calls the `PlayLevelScreen's` `onLevelCompleted`
method when it has beaten the level in order for `PlayLevelScreen` to know to change states. From there, `PlayLevelScreen` changes flagManager again to
the `LEVEL_WIN_MESSAGE` flagManager and shows the "Level Cleared" screen for a short amount of time before bringing the player back
to the game's main menu.

The "Level Cleared" screen is a separate `Screen` class (`LevelClearedScreen.java`) whose only job is to
paint the screen black and show the "Level Cleared" text. The `PlayLevelScreen` sets up and loads the `LevelClearedScreen` from within itself,
rather than making a separate entry in the `ScreenCoordinator` class -- this is important in order to not bloat the `ScreenCoordinator` class, as it should
really only be used for the "core" screens of the game. While it may seem to not make much sense to have created an entire separate screen class for `LevelClearedScreen`
for such a tiny amount of functionality, it's important for keeping the game code organized -- if in the future the graphics for the level cleared
screen were to get more complex and involved, it's best to keep it separate and out of the `PlayLevelScreen` class to make the graphic drawing easier to work with and 
prevent `PlayLevelScreen` from becoming bloated.

### Player Dead State

When the player dies in the level from touching an enemy, the level is "lost" and the `PlayLevelScreen's` flagManager is changed to `PLAYER_DEAD`.
Note that this flagManager change is actually triggered by the `Player`, which calls the `PlayLevelScreen's` `onDeath`
method when it has died in a level in order for `PlayLevelScreen` to know to change states. From there, `PlayLevelScreen` changes flagManager again to
the `LEVEL_LOSE_MESSAGE` flagManager and shows the "You lose!" screen. The "You lose" screen allows the player to press the space key to restart the level
or the escape key to go back to the main menu.

![losing-level.gif](../../../assets/images/losing-level.gif)

The "You lose!" screen is a separate `Screen` class (`LevelLoseScreen.java`) which paints the screen black and shows the "You lose!" text,
as well as the text with instructions for what the player can do from this screen (press the space key to restart the level, or press
the escape key to go back to the main menu). The `LevelLoseScreen` class handles detecting those key inputs and sets `ScreenCoordinator's` game flagManager
accordingly based on what the user presses -- which is essentially just this:

```java
if (Keyboard.isKeyDown(Key.SPACE)) {
    playLevelScreen.resetLevel();
} else if (Keyboard.isKeyDown(Key.ESC)) {
    playLevelScreen.goBackToMenu();
}
```

The `PlayLevelScreen` class instance is passed into the `LevelLoseScreen` class as well, and as you can see above the
`PlayLevelScreen` exposes methods for `resetLevel` and `goBackToMenu` to make things easier.
